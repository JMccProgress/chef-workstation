# nodejs-binary provides nodejs using the binary packages provided by
# the upstream.  Because this is for build-time use only, it does not does
# not install it into `install_dir` and so does not need to be cleaned up.
# Instead, it's  instead it's retained in the build cache location.
#
# The specific path is shared via the environment variable `omnibus_nodejs_dir`
# which gets set when this software definition is loaded.
#
# To use the nodejs binaries (npm, node) first ensure this is a dependency for
# your component; then:
#   *nix, mac,  add ENV['omnibus_nodejs_dir']/bin to the PATH within the `build` block.
#   * For Windows, add ENV['omnibus_nodejs_dir']  and do not append '\bin'
#
#
# To ensure no ordering issues around load v build time resolution,
# it may be necessary to include a `block in your `build` block.
# Here's an example:
# ```
# build do
#  block "stuff-to-run-only-after-all-definitions-are-loaded" do
#   env = with_standard_compiler_flags(with_embedded_path)
#   node_tools_dir = ENV['omnibus_nodejs_dir']
#   node_bin_path = windows? ? node_tools_dir : File.join(node_tools_dir, "bin")
#   separator = File::PATH_SEPARATOR || ":"
#   env['PATH'] = "#{env['PATH']}#{separator}#{node_bin_path}"
#   command "npm build", env: env
#  end
# end
# ```
